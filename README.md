# Challenge Digbang - React

This repository is an implementation of the [Digbang React challenge](https://github.com/digbang/ejercicio-react)

for this challenge I used the following technologies:

- [ReactJS](https://es.react.dev/) as a tool for the creation of the user interface
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as a developer tool for enhance javascript developer experience
- [rc-slider](https://github.com/react-component/slider) as a library that exposes a slider component
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) I chose Tailwind CSS because it's a tool that allows working with CSS in an organized, efficient manner, and it's easily extensible.
- [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) as the JavaScript bundler
